# FizzBuzz

FizzBuzz is a simple programming exercise described in the following prompt:

>Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

It's a fun way to build competency in new and familiar languages by exploring different programming practices and approaches such as parameterization and procedural vs. functional programming. I created this repository as a place to do just that.
